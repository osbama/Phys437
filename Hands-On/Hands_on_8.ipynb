    "Symmetries are at the heart of physics. Indeed in condensed matter and\n",
    "particle physics we often define a thing simply by the symmetries it\n",
    "adheres to. What does symmetry mean for those in machine learning? In\n",
    "this context the ambition is straightforward --- it is a means to reduce\n",
    "the parameter space and improve the trained model\\'s ability to\n",
    "sucessfully label unseen data, i.e., its ability to generalise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have a learning task and the data we are learning from has an\n",
    "underlying symmetry. For example, consider a game of Noughts and Crosses\n",
    "(aka Tic-tac-toe): if we win a game, we would have won it if the board\n",
    "was rotated or flipped along any of the lines of symmetry. Now if we\n",
    "want to train an algorithm to spot the outcome of these games, we can\n",

    "multiple configurations of the board as \\'the same thing\\' as far as the\n",
    "symmetry is concerned. This means we can reduce our parameter space, and\n",
    "so the amount of data our algorithm must sift through is immediately\n",
    "reduced. Along the way, the fact that our learning model must encode a\n",
    "symmetry that actually exists in the system we are trying to represent\n",
    "naturally encourages our results to be more generalisable. The encoding\n",
    "of symmetries into our learning models is where the term *equivariance*\n",
    "will appear. We will see that demanding that certain symmetries are\n",

    "first place? The answer lies in the world of group representation\n",
    "theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let\\'s define what we mean by a group:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition**: A group is a set $G$ together with a binary operation on\n",
    "$G$, here denoted $\\circ,$ that combines any two elements $a$ and $b$ to\n",
    "form an element of $G,$ denoted $a \\circ b,$ such that the following\n",
    "three requirements, known as group axioms, are satisfied as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Associativity**: For all $a, b, c$ in $G,$ one has\n",
    "    $(a \\circ b) \\circ c=a \\circ (b \\circ c).$\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  \n",
    "\n",
    "    **Identity element**: There exists an element $e$ in $G$ such that, for every $a$ in $G,$ one\n",
    "\n",
    "    :   has $e \\circ a=a$ and $a \\circ e=a.$ Such an element is unique.\n",
    "        It is called the identity element of the group.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  \n",
    "\n",
    "    **Inverse element**: For each $a$ in $G,$ there exists an element $b$ in $G$\n",
    "\n",
    "    :   such that $a \\circ b=e$ and $b \\circ a=e,$ where $e$ is the\n",
    "        identity element. For each $a,$ the element $b$ is unique: it is\n",
    "        called the inverse of $a$ and is commonly denoted $a^{-1}.$\n",
    "\n",
    "With groups defined, we are in a position to articulate what a\n",
    "representation is: Let $\\varphi$ be a map sending $g$ in group $G$ to a\n",
    "linear map $\\varphi(g): V \\rightarrow V,$ for some vector space $V,$\n",
    "which satisfies\n",

    "\n",
    "The idea here is that just as elements in a group act on each other to\n",
    "reach further elements, i.e., $g\\circ h = k,$ a representation sends us\n",
    "to a mapping acting on a vector space such that\n",
    "$\\varphi(g)\\circ \\varphi(h) = \\varphi(k).$ In this way we are\n",
    "representing the structure of the group as a linear map. For a\n",
    "representation, our mapping must send us to the general linear group\n",
    "$GL(n)$ (the space of invertible $n \\times n$ matrices with matrix\n",
    "multiplication as the group multiplication). Note how this is both a\n",
    "group, and by virtue of being a collection of invertible matrices, also\n",
    "a set of linear maps (they\\'re all invertble matrices that can act on\n",
    "row vectors). Fundamentally, representation theory is based on the\n",
    "prosaic observation that linear algebra is easy and group theory is\n",
    "abstract. So what if we can study groups via linear maps?\n",
    "\n",
    "Now due to the importance of unitarity in quantum mechnics, we are\n",

    "![](Hands_on_8_images/sphere_equivariant.png)\n",

    "symmetries can be characterised as a group, where all the elements of\n",
    "the group leave some space we are considering unchanged. Let\\'s consider\n",
    "an example: the symmetries of a sphere. Now when we think of this\n",
    "symmetry we probably think something along the lines of \\\"it\\'s the same\n",
    "no matter how we rotate it, or flip it left to right, etc\\\". There is\n",
    "this idea of being invariant under some operation. We also have the idea\n",
    "of being able to undo these actions: if we rotate one way, we can rotate\n",
    "it back. If we flip the sphere right-to-left we can flip it\n",
    "left-to-right to get back to where we started (notice too all these\n",
    "inverses are unique). Trivially we can also do nothing. What exactly are\n",
    "we describing here? We have elements that correspond to an action on a\n",

    "structure of the symmeteries in a quantum circuit we must restrict our\n",
    "gates to being unitary representations of the group.\n",

    "In this demo, we saw how to implement a symmetry-invariant VQLM to learn\n",
    "the energy and forces of small chemical systems and trained it for the\n",
    "specific example of water. The strong points with respect to\n",
    "symmetry-agnostic techniques are better generalization, more accurate\n",
    "force predictions, resilience to small data corruption, and reduction in\n",
    "classical pre- and postprocessing, as supported by the original paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further work could be devoted to studying larger systems by adopting a\n",
    "more systematic fragmentation as discussed in the original paper. As an\n",
    "alternative to building symmetry-invariant quantum architectures, the\n",
    "symmetries could instead be incorporated into the training routine, such\n",
    "as recently proposed by. Finally, symmetry-aware models could be used to\n",
    "design quantum symmetry functions, which in turn could serve as\n",
    "symmetry-invariant descriptors of the chemical systems within classical\n",
    "deep learning architectures, which can be easily operated and trained at\n",
