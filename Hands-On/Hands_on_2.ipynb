In the single-qubit case, the position of the Bloch vector along an axis nicely corresponds to the expectation value of measuring in that basis. If we take this as _the_ rule of plotting Bloch vectors, we arrive at this conclusion above. This shows us there is _no_ single-qubit measurement basis for which a specific measurement is guaranteed. This contrasts with our single qubit states, in which we could always pick a single-qubit basis.
