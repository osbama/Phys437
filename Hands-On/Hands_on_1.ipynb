    "\n",
    "Classical bits always have a completely well-defined state: they are either 0 or 1 at every point during a computation. There is no more detail we can add to the state of a bit than this. So to write down the state of a of classical bit `(c)`, we can just use these two binary values. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "c = 0\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This restriction is lifted for quantum bits. Whether we get a $0$ or a $1$ from a qubit only needs to be well-defined when a measurement is made to extract an output. At that point, it must commit to one of these two options. At all other times, its state will be something more complex than can be captured by a simple binary value.\n",
    "\n",
    "To see how to describe these, we can first focus on the two simplest cases. It is possible to prepare a qubit in a state for which it definitely gives the outcome $0$ when measured.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need a name for this state. Let's be unimaginative and call it *0*. Similarly, there exists a qubit state that is certain to output a $1$. We'll call this *1*. These two states are completely mutually exclusive. Either the qubit definitely outputs a $0$, or it definitely outputs a $1$. There is no overlap. One way to represent this with mathematics is to use two orthogonal vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\left|0\\right\\rangle= \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\qquad \\left|1\\right\\rangle= \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "With vectors we can describe more complex states than just $\\left|0\\right\\rangle$ and $\\left|1\\right\\rangle$. For example, consider the vector\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\left|q_0\\right\\rangle= \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}  \\\\ \\frac{i}{\\sqrt{2}} \\end{pmatrix}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the states $\\left|0\\right\\rangle$ and $\\left|1\\right\\rangle$ form an orthonormal basis, we can represent any 2D vector with a combination of these two states. This allows us to write the state of our qubit in the alternative form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\left|q_0\\right\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left|0\\right\\rangle + \\frac{i}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left|1\\right\\rangle\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This vector, $\\left|q_0\\right\\rangle$ is called the qubit's _statevector_, it tells us everything we could possibly know about this qubit. For now, we are only able to draw a few simple conclusions about this particular example of a statevector: it is not entirely $\\left|0\\right\\rangle$ and not entirely $\\left|1\\right\\rangle$. Instead, it is described by a linear combination of the two. In quantum mechanics, we typically describe linear combinations such as this using the word 'superposition'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though our example state $\\left|q_0\\right\\rangle$ can be expressed as a superposition of $\\left|0\\right\\rangle$ and $\\left|1\\right\\rangle$, it is no less a definite and well-defined qubit state than they are. To see this, we can begin to explore how a qubit can be manipulated"

As such, they would be no different from classical bits and our computation could be easily replaced by a classical computation.
