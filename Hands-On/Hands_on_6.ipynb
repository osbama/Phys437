    "# Introducing (Dynamical) Lie Algebras for quantum practitioners\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Lie algebras, pronounced like the name \\\"Lee\\\", offer a fresh\n",
    "perspective on some of the established ideas in quantum physics and\n",
    "become more and more important in quantum computing. Let us recap some\n",
    "of the key concepts of quantum mechanics and how they relate to and give\n",
    "rise to Lie algebras.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most physicists know quantum physics in terms of wavefunctions\n",
    "$|\\psi\\rangle$ that live in a [Hilbert\n",
    "space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_space) $\\mathcal{H},$ as\n",
    "well as (bounded) linear operators $\\hat{O}$ that live in the space of\n",
    "linear operators on that Hilbert space, $\\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{H}).$ For\n",
    "finite dimensional systems (think, $n$ number of qubits) we have complex\n",
    "valued state vectors (wavefunctions) in $\\mathcal{H} = \\mathbb{C}^{2^n}$\n",
    "with norm 1 and square matrices (linear operators) in\n",
    "$\\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{H}) = \\mathbb{C}^{2^n \\times 2^n}.$\n",
    "\n",
    "Two very important sub-classes of linear operators in quantum mechanics\n",
    "are unitary and Hermitian operators. Hermitian operators $H$ are\n",
    "self-adjoint, $H^\\dagger = H,$ and describe observables that can be\n",
    "measured. Unitary operators are norm-preserving such that\n",
    "$\\langle \\psi | U^\\dagger U | \\psi \\rangle = \\langle \\psi | \\psi \\rangle,$\n",
    "in particular we have $U^{-1} = U^\\dagger.$ They describe how quantum\n",
    "states are transformed and ensure that their norm is preserved.\n",
    "\n",
    "A unitary operator can always be written as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$U = e^{-i H},$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where we say that $H$ is the generator of $U.$ Take for example a single\n",
    "qubit rotation $U(\\phi) = e^{-i \\frac{\\phi}{2} X}.$ $U(\\phi)$ is the\n",
    "unitary evolution that rotates a quantum state in Hilbert space around\n",
    "the x-axis on the [Bloch\n",
    "sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloch_sphere), and is generated by\n",
    "the Pauli $X$ [matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauli_matrices).\n",
    "\n",
    "The space of all such unitary operators forms the so-called special\n",
    "unitary group $SU(N),$ where for qubit systems we have $N=2^n$ with $N$\n",
    "the dimension of the group and 'n' the number of qubits. In\n",
    "quantum computing, we are typically dealing with the Hilbert space\n",
    "$\\mathcal{H} = \\mathbb{C}^{2^n}$ and for full universality we require\n",
    "the available gates to span all of $SU(2^n).$ That means when we have\n",
    "all unitaries of $SU(2^n)$ available to us, we can reach any state in\n",
    "Hilbert space from any other state.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Lie group $SU(2^n)$ has an associated Lie algebra to it, called\n",
    "$\\mathfrak{su}(2^n)$ (more on that later). In some cases, it is more\n",
    "convenient to work with the associated Lie algebra rather than the Lie\n",
    "group.\n",
    "\n",
    "So if you are familiar with quantum computing but knew nothing about Lie\n",
    "algebras and Lie groups before this demo, the good news is that you\n",
    "actually already know the elements of both. Roughly speaking, the\n",
    "relevant Lie group in quantum computing is the space of unitaries, and\n",
    "the relevant Lie algebra is the space of Hermitian matrices. Further,\n",
    "they are related to each other: The Lie algebra (Hermitian matrices)\n",

    "\n",
    "The last one, anti-commutativity, technically is not an axiom but\n",
    "follows from bilinearity and alternativity, but is so crucial that it is\n",
    "worth highlighting. These properties generally define the so-called Lie\n",
    "bracket, where the commutator is just one special case thereof. A\n",
    "different example would be the\n",

    "(\\\"vectors\\\") in $\\mathfrak{g}$ are actually operators (matrices) in our\n",

    "One very relevant Lie algebra for us is the special unitary algebra\n",

    "linear combinations are strictly over the reals. In fact, you may\n",
    "sometimes find references to $\\mathfrak{su}(N)$ being the Hermitian\n",

    "This means that Hermitian operators are not closed under commutation,\n",
    "and thus do not form a Lie algebra (because the commutator maps outside\n",
    "the set of Hermitian matrices). But instead, skew-Hermitian operators\n",

    "\"dynamical Lie algebra (DLA)\" of the circuit. The complexity of $\\mathfrak{g}$-sim is\n",
    "determined by the dimension of the corresponding Lie algebra,\n",

    "increase in size is polynomial.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Lie-algebraic simulation techniques such as $\\mathfrak{g}$-sim can be\n",
    "handy in the niche cases where the\n",
    "dynamical Lie algebra (DLA) scales polynomially with the number of qubits. Because those\n",
    "cases essentially boil down to the transverse field Ising model (TFIM)\n",
    "and variants thereof in 1D, we will do a case study on its DLA\n",
    "specifically.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are interested in the case where we want to extend the DLA\n",
    "$\\mathfrak{g}$ by a few additional gates that are outside the DLA. For\n",
    "$n$ qubits we get a DLA dimension of\n",
    "$\\text{dim}(\\mathfrak{g}) = 2n(2n-1)/2$ for the TFIM. Suppose we want to expand the DLA by a single operator $p$\n",
    "in order to use it as a gate, and let us assume that $p$ is the product\n",
    "of two DLA operators that, itself, is not part of the DLA. Adding\n",
    "product operators to the TFIM DLA and computing their new Lie closure\n",
    "can lead to an exponential increase with a new dimension up to\n",
    "$2(2^{2n-2}-1).$ In that worst case, we get the so-called associative\n",
    "algebra of $\\mathfrak{g};$ that is, the algebra from the\n",
    "closure over multiplication, i.e. which looks at all possible products\n",
    "of operators. This is also a Lie algebra.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we show how to extend the DLA by such a $p$ gate without going to\n",
    "the exponentially large associative algebra, but instead make use of the\n",
    "fact that $p$ is a product of DLA elements. We do so by looking at\n",
    "moments of $\\mathfrak{g}$ instead. The $m$-th order\n",
    "moments are products of $(m+1)$ DLA elements. E.g.\n",
    "$p = h_{\\alpha_1} h_{\\alpha_2} \\notin \\mathfrak{g}$ is a first order\n",
    "moment. Depending on their order, every non-DLA moment gate increases\n",
    "the highest moment order considered in the computation, $m_\\text{comp}$.\n",
    "The overall cost scales with the maximum order\n",
    "$\\text{dim}(\\mathfrak{g})^{m_\\text{comp}}.$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the worst case, each moment expands the space of operators by a\n",
    "factor $\\text{dim}(\\mathfrak{g}),$ such that for $m$ moments, we are\n",
    "dealing with a $\\text{dim}(\\mathfrak{g})^{m+2}$ dimensional space. In\n",
    "that sense, this is similar to\n",
    "Clifford+T simulators where expensive $T$ gates come with an exponential cost. A\n",
    "key difference is that for a finite dimensional DLA, there is a maximum\n",
    "moment $m_\\text{max}.$ This corresponds to simply constructing the full\n",

    "$2^{n_S} \\geq M.$ Note that $\\langle O_m \\rangle = \\text{tr}[O_m \\rho],$\n",
    "so we can have mixed or even infinite-dimensional states $\\rho.$\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We introduced the basic concepts of shadow Hamiltonian simulation and\n",

    "Hamiltonian simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have seen how classical Hamiltonian simulation is tightly connected\n",
    "to g-sim, but run on a quantum computer. A significant difference comes\n",
    "from the fact that the authors in specifically look at Hamiltonian\n",
    "simulation, $\\exp(-i t H),$ which allows us to just look at operators\n",
    "$O_m$ that support all commutators $[H, O_m],$ instead of the full Lie\n",
    "closure. There may be some advantage to this feat, because Lie algebras\n",
    "in quantum computing typically scale exponentially. However, the scaling\n",
    "of such sets of operators is unclear at this point and needs further\n",
    "investigation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that even in the case of an exponentially sized set of operators,\n",
    "we have --- at least in principle --- an exponentially large state\n",
    "vector to store the $M \\leq 2^{n_S}$ values. In the absolute worst case\n",
    "we have $\\mathfrak{su}(2^n)$ with a dimension of $2^{2n}-1,$ so\n",
    "$n_S = 2n$ and thus it is just doubling the number of qubits.\n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest potential to this new persepctive on Hamiltonian simulation\n",
    "most likely lies in finding interesting applications like or that\n",
    "naturally encode the problem and allow for efficient retrieval of all\n",
