    "## The four postulates of Quantum Mechanics\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, our aim is to study computing devices which operate according to the laws of quantum mechanics. Developed during the early 20th century by physicists Max Planck, Albert Einstein, Erwin Schrödinger and many others, quantum mechanics is a set of mathematical laws which describe the behaviour of subatomic particles such as protons, electrons, and photons. Although the theory has proven remarkably successful since its inception, it is nevertheless notoriously counterintuitive, an aspect which we shall explore in this lecture. Quantum mechanics is based on four postulates, which describe the following four intuitive ideas: How to describe a single quantum system, how to perform quantum operations on a quantum system, how to describe multiple quantum systems, and how to measure or extract classical information from a quantum system.\n",

In the quantum world, we immediately see a radical departure from this statement, a quantum bit, or qubit, can take on not just 0 or 1, but rather both values 0 and 1 simultaneously. This is a very deep and counterintuitive statement, so it worth reflecting on:  it is like saying you can be both asleep and awake at the same time, or here on Earth and simultaneously on Mars at the same time. Indeed, relative to life as we know it, _it makes no sense!_\n",

    "How do we mathematically model the act of measuring or observing a quantum system considering that the very act of looking at or observing a quantum system irreversibly alters the state of the system? To model this phenomenon, we shall use the notion of a projective or von Neumann measurement (named after Hungarian child prodigy and mathematician, John von Neumann, who was apparently already familiar with calculus at the age of 8). To do so, we must define three classes of linear operators, each of which is increasingly more restricted. All three classes will prove vital throughout this course.\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. *Hermitian operators*: An operator $M \\in \\mathcal L \\left(\\mathbb C^d \\right)$ is Hermitian if $M = M^\\dagger$ . Examples you are already familiar with are the Pauli $X$, $Y$ , and $Z$ gates, which are not only unitary, but also Hermitian. A Hermitian operator has the important property that all of its eigenvalues are real. Thus, Hermitian operators can be thought of as a higher dimensional generalization of the real numbers.\n",
    " 2. *Positive semi-definite operators*: If a Hermitian operator has only non-negative eigenvalues, then it is called positive-semidefinite. Thus, positive semi-definite (or positive for short) matrices generalize the non-negative real numbers.\n",
    " 3. *Orthogonal projection operators*: A Hermitian matrix $\\Pi \\in \\mathcal L \\left(\\mathbb C^d \\right)$ is an orthogonal projection operator (or projector for short) if $\\Pi^2=\\Pi$. This is equivalent to saying $\\Pi$ has only eigenvalues 0 and 1. Let us prove this equivalence briefly: Since $\\Pi$ is Hermitian, we can take its spectral decomposition, $\\Pi = \\sum_i \\lambda_i \\left|\\lambda_i\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle\\lambda_i\\right|$.

    "\n",
    "   It is important to note that since a projector $\\Pi$’s eigenvalues are all 0 or 1, its spectral decomposition must take the form $\\Pi=\\sum_i \\left|\\psi_i\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle\\psi_i\\right|$, where $\\left\\{\\left|\\psi_i\\right\\rangle\\right\\}$ are an orthonormal set. Conversely, summing any set of orthonormal $\\left\\{\\left|\\psi_i\\right\\rangle\\right\\}$ in this fashion yields projector.

    "The exercise above has an important moral — requiring a quantum state $\\left|\\psi\\right\\rangle$ to be a unit vector (i.e. $\\left|\\alpha\\right|^2 + \\left|\\beta\\right|^2 = 1$) ensures that when measuring $\\left|\\psi\\right\\rangle$, the distribution over the outcomes is a valid probability distribution, i.e. the probabilities for all possible outcomes sum to 1. The other important take-home message here is that measurements in quantum mechanics are inherently probabilistic — in general, the outcomes cannot be perfectly predicted! Finally, we started this lecture by saying that the very act of measuring a quantum state disturbs the system. Let us now formalize this; we will crucially use the fact discussed earlier that a projector projects a vector $\\left|\\psi\\right\\rangle$ down into a smaller subspace.

Your friend Alice now phones you and asks to borrow your state. How can you send it to her? One obvious way is simply to pop your system in the mail and physically send it over.

Call these bits $b_0 b_1$ . Now you pick up the telephone, call Alice, and tell her the value of $b_0 b_1$ . Conditioned on $b_0 $ , she applies X to her half of the Bell pair, followed by Z conditioned on $b_1$. The claim is that at this point, Alice’s qubit’s state has been magically converted to $\\left|\\psi\\right\\rangle$.

There are four terms in this superposition, each of which begins with a distinct bit string $\\left|00\\right\\rangle$, $\\left|01\\right\\rangle$, $\\left|10\\right\\rangle$, or $\\left|11\\right\\rangle$. This means that if you now measure qubits 1 and 2 in the standard basis and obtain outcome (say) $\\left|00\\right\\rangle$, then Alice’s qubit on wire 3 collapses to the only consistent possibility, $\\alpha\\left|0\\right\\rangle + \\beta\\left|1\\right\\rangle$.
