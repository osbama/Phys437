    "## 1. Quantum signal processing\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture, we describe the powerful framework of quantum signal processing [73](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02685). Given an operator represented using a so-called block encoding, we can encode spectral information about it in a qubit through the concept of qubitization [74](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06546) and then transform it by quantum signal processing to implement a function of the block-encoded operator. Applying this method to the Hamiltonian simulation problem, and using the method of oblivious amplitude amplification discussed in the last lecture to boost the amplitude of the blockencoded evolution, this approach can be used to simulate sparse Hamiltonians with an optimal complexity tradeoff. These techniques can also be applied in a wide variety of other algorithms [49](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.01838).\n",

    "Note that for $A$ to have a block encoding, it must satisfy $\\|A\\| \\leq 1$. However, we often consider block encodings under rescaling.

Furthermore, suppose $\\max _{i, j}\\left|A_{i j}\\right| \\leq 1$ (this assumption is without loss of generality since we can always rescale $A$ with a corresponding change to the block-encoding constant $\\alpha$ ).

    "To understand the quality of the approximation, we must bound the error incurred by truncating the infinite series. We omit the details of this analysis here since it is technical and not very illuminating, but one can show that the error is $O\\left((t / 2)^{K} / K!\\right)[23]$. (Note that this is very similar to the error analysis for the linear combination of unitaries method as in (26.6), but without the exponential-in- $t$ prefactor that prevents us from directly taking large values of $t$ with that method.) To make this $O(\\epsilon)$, one can show that it suffices to take [49, Lemma 59](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.01838)\n",

    "Since this is scaled down by a factor of 2 , we need to scale it back up to achieve the desired (deterministic) simulation. We can do this using (robust) oblivious amplitude amplification with only constant-factor overhead. Overall, this gives a quantum algorithm for sparse Hamiltonian simulation with optimal query complexity as a function of both $t$ and $\\epsilon$.\n",
